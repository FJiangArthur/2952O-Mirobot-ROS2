CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrviz.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "rviz", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rviz" with any of
  the following names:

    rvizConfig.cmake
    rviz-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rviz" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rviz_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "rviz"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
